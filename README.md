# join2vec: Semantic-Rich and Efficient String Similarity Joins with Vector Embeddings

Manos Chatzakis (emmanouil.chatzakis@epfl.ch), Viktor Sanca, Anastasia Ailamaki

join2vec is a framework that utilizes deep learning word embeddings to perform semantic rich similarity joins in relational databases. It was developed during summer@EPFL program and during a semeter project in collaboration with DIAS lab, advised by Viktor Sanca and Anastasia Ailamaki.

Part of join2vec algorithms and implementations are included in the paper "Context-Enhanced Relational Operators via Neural Embeddings", Viktor Sanca, Manos Chatzakis and Anastasia Ailamaki, to be submitted in VLDB.
